   |---> DFileServer 2.0.1 - 2024-08-12

   |---> DFileServer 2.0.0 - 2023-2024
   |   ^ - Update code to support C++17 features.
   |   | - Thread safe Interprocess Messanger to facilitate communication between threads.
   |   | - Platform specific C directory code converted to C++ unified directory code.
   |   | - 1.1.4 Fix for basic Authentication applied.
   |
   | - Original 2.0.0 branch lost to time. Was an attempt at multithreading the program to make
   |   scale better with more concurrent connections. The idea was to make the tiniest little webserver
   |   that could. This 2.0.0 branch is going to be slightly different. First, I've grown as a programmer.
   |   DFileServer was my first real attempt at a C++ program, and not only have I changed, but so has
   |   C++. I'm going to clean the code base, add threading, and make it easier to add features for the
   |   future. An upload form was also originally planned, to make it a very easy file sharing tool.
   |   That idea is still fascinating. We'll see.
