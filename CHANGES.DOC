   |---> DFileServer 2.1.0 - [Date] [The Red Deer Redemption]
   |   | - Redesigned and updated Interprocess Messenger that allows task sending down a
   |   |   channel that can be accepted and locked in by a single thread that can take it.
   |   | - Interprocess Messengers can pause ( with or without a timeout ) until a message is
   |   |   received, removing the need for sleep delays on threads that primarily respond to messages.
   |   | - Network stack broken into a listener thread, and multiple HTTP delivery threads,
   |   |   finally making good on the 2.0 promise of scalable threading.
   |   | - Directory Index updated to a new modern cleaner look.
   |   | - IPv6 support and HTTPS ( IPv4 ) support.
   |   | - Newly implemented TCPInterfaces structure that allows for multiple Interfaces
   |   |   (IPv4, IPv6, HTTPS IPv4) to be bound to ports, and allowing for them to be active
   |   |   at the same time if wanted, allowing for the server to distribute across a vast array
   |   |   of protocols simutaniously. Work is going to be going on this to allow them to distribute
   |   |   differently as well in the future, but for now this works.

   |   |
   |---> DFileServer 2.0.0 - 2023-2024 [The Port Colborne Comeback]
   |   ^ - Update code to support C++17 features.
   |   | - Thread safe Interprocess Messanger to facilitate communication between threads.
   |   | - Platform specific C directory code converted to C++ unified directory code.
   |   | - 1.1.4 Fix for basic Authentication applied.
   |
   | - Original 2.0.0 branch lost to time. Was an attempt at multithreading the program to make
   |   scale better with more concurrent connections. The idea was to make the tiniest little webserver
   |   that could. This 2.0.0 branch is going to be slightly different. First, I've grown as a programmer.
   |   DFileServer was my first real attempt at a C++ program, and not only have I changed, but so has
   |   C++. I'm going to clean the code base, add threading, and make it easier to add features for the
   |   future. An upload form was also originally planned, to make it a very easy file sharing tool.
   |   That idea is still fascinating. We'll see.
